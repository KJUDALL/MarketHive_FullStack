# MarketHive

## Description

Who says being a shopaholic is a bad thing? If you're looking for a website that will knock your socks off with all the latest and greatest styles in fashion, then look no further! You've come to the right place. MarketHive prides itself on being a functional, user friendly, and responsive full stack application. We use data models (Postgres & Sequelize), CRUD routes (Node.js & Express.js for RESTful API's), servers, and user auth (via JWT) to name a few. Additionally, React has been utilized for our frontend framework. We are also protecting our API keys and sensitive information with environment variables. And lastly, we are deployed using Render. Enjoy!

Here is a link to our deployed application: https://markethive-fullstack.onrender.com

## Screenshots
Unfortunately, we did not get a chance to finish out the frontend portion of our full stack app. However, here are screenshots of the wireframe to depict what we would like it to appear as.

## Installation

Users can clone this code repo using an IDE of choice. They must ensure node.js and express.js files are present in the repo. User must install pg as a postgreSQL package manager. Because this code base uses JavaScript + React (JSX), users must utilize 'npx tsc' to build the app and 'npx nodemon' to run the app - client and server side alike. The application should populate without any issues if all of this has been done correctly.
